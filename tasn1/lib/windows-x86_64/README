General Note:
While I'm not a fan of deploying binaries, I do this here for AppVeyor testing purposes and lazy users,
though I recommend to get Your own copies from ?.

I wasn't able to compile successfully with a mingw installation: many makefile errors !
Thus I took the .dll from https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/tree/master/gtk-nsis-pack/bin
The .lib was generated with Visual Studio 2017 tools.


This folder has to be populated at least with file libtasn1-6.lib (COFF format for -m64, 64 bit), preferrably import library (or static lib; I didn't test using a static lib).


At Your option (if You opted for the import library) place the .dll here as well (and within %PATH%), and dub.json (copyFiles-windows-*)
will copy the .dll to directory 'targetPath' (in turn for possibly different Windows builds), thus this ensures, that always the
matching pair of import lib and .dll is used.

v90  =   Visual Studio 2008
v100 = Visual Studio 2010
v110 = Visual Studio 2012
v120 = Visual Studio 2013
v130 =   Visual Studio 14
v140 = Visual Studio 2015
v141 = Visual Studio 2017
v142 = Visual Studio 2019

AppVeyor provides these “standard” build worker images:

    Visual Studio 2013
    Visual Studio 2015   the current default
    Visual Studio 2017
